Its pretty shame that theres not a disclaimer on those keypad barrels that they sell at the prescription pickup window to say, hey, you know, you better not put this in here without having your paper torn off and slid inside. Its just amazing. Yeah, okay. I dont think people have a lot of bread that are in trouble that are going through it. I could be wrong. I mean, I suppose that people with a big bank account have problems, but I never did, you know what Im saying? Life was grand. I had money to do anything I wanted to do.

I got Walmart and Amazon to bring me my things and I just work and relax. I dont spend money. I dont have a social life. And money can grow. Money can grow for me pretty quick. As long as were getting our overtime, Im getting those 1000 plus take home paychecks and my kids arent beating me up. And really all I got to do is not share with them how Im working all kinds of hours. Theyre pretty 27 year old son and a 22 year old daughter with my grandson is four. So Ive been supporting my daughter and my grandson really for several years. And theres no dad in the picture. His mom calls me dad. My daughter calls me dad.

And its just something that it cant really be done, but with AI, it can be online family reunion kind of thing.

September 2019, I get off work. We did a 26 hours shift. On my way home I bought some wow, I cant remember what its called. Its the cinnamon whiskey fireball. Got home, took a shower and everything and consumed. After I woke up from sleeping, I consumed two of those little small fireball shots, got on my motorcycle, ran to the store because it was almost eleven and I had a female over. And on my way back I got pulled over. I was fine when I got pulled over, I was not operating intoxicated, but ended up with the tragedy of my first and only ever DUI. I wont ever get another one and shouldnt have got that one. So I was in a DUI school where I was the teachers assistant by volunteer and there was 40 people in that room. And Ill give you a quick example. The question was, how much has this whole DUI thing cost? Court costs, attorneys fees, misfortune, whatever, how much it costs, right? And the answers were anywhere from really like $400 on the low end to $5,000 on the high end. And then when it got to me, when it got to me, I said, Im going to pass. Lets get the rest of you guys, because I was like in the middle of the room, back of the room. Theres probably twelve other people after me. So then we came back to me at the end. I said, I dont think you all are thinking of the big picture here. My expense for this thing is a million dollars. Ive lost so much and I lost credibility. I was just weeks away from being a crane operator. Right now we make a $40 an hour, 70 hours a week, bringing home 3000 gross pay a week.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"We havent.

I mean, I need money in order to make all this happen. And its been a slow year. I got real accustomed to making my take home pay was 1112 and $1,300 a week. And man, I dont know. Im very lucky. Weve got a 40 hours minimum pay. We still get more than 40 hours and make overtime. But if we have a week, thats bad, 19 and a half hours, for example, we still get paid for 40. Ive had too many of those $692 deposits this year. Its not for me. I love my job. And if I won the lottery or if I have a business that takes off and Ive got a million dollars in the bank, Im still going to work at Fort Manatee. Its something I love to do. Okay.

Wheres my do not?","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Okay, I want to say something for you. In 2007, probably, maybe even a little earlier, I started working with a company called E Boulevard. Its the same thing as our ability to share screens and take people through a webinar demo. And I did a webinar Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. I had sales reps that went out and talked to people on the phone, and just all they had to do was invite them to a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday webinar. Right. Whichever one they wanted to go to. And I would demo the product and say all the right things and bring in thousands of dollars every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. So Im good at selling. Im very persuasive, or at least I used to be. And its definitely something I can do. So what kind of options do you have other than helping people who are getting shit on in their life?","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Funnels?

But we also are just stepping into our busy season. This is when I started last year. This, by the way, is the same company that I worked for in 2019 when I lost my job, but they branched off of they worked with Federal Marine Terminal, and they branched off and did World Direct Shipping.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Hello?","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Well, remember I said that my total investments right now are just about $1,000. However, the gentleman, father and son who owned the biggest farmers market in Georgia, its the farmers market in the cow county owned this company I work for at Port Manatee called World Direct Shipping, where they have grown the numbers at Port Manatee exponentially. Weve got new warehouses being built, a train track coming through to send produce that we get from Mexico out to Philadelphia. Its just amazing what theyve done. And they grew even during COVID-19. Those guys. If I have something thats a makes sense money making situation, I think that they believe in me enough as one of their charter employees that they would invest. So Ill say that I can get a couple of DUI got in September 2019, I ended up having to go to jail for that. For how long was it? 30 days. 30 days in jail? 29 days, actually. And when I got out the jail right there at the port, I went straight to work. Right. Those guys paid me. I got payroll the next day. And it wasnt a loan or in advance or anything. It was just, hey, we believe in you. And here you go. Heres a full paycheck. So theyre good guys. I think I can get $2,000. Really? If its something thats real, that they think that they can get their money back with a little return on investment or just see me shine, you know what I mean?

It was 5600 sqft. Its worth 2.7 million now. Short sale it for 550 and eleven. And life took a terrible turn when the real estate bubble hit. I owned Help Me Sell.com in Americas Listing Service and made money hand over fist. I made as much in a week sometimes as I do in a year right now.

I think after I take my shower, Im going to soak in a little bit of Epsom salt for 15 minutes and I think Im going to crash because Ive got work again tomorrow. Okay. Im going to look over this probably when I wake up. Im in a position at work where I have a lot of downtime and matter of fact, I do a lot of the stuff Ive done on my website at work as a header on the ship.
